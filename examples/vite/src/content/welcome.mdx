# Welcome to MDX Hybrid! ðŸš€

<Alert type="success">
  This page is compiled using MDX Hybrid, providing blazing-fast compilation with automatic engine selection!
</Alert>

MDX Hybrid combines the **speed of Rust** with the **flexibility of JavaScript** to give you the best MDX compilation experience.

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, export data, and write JSX directly in your markdown files.

<Button onClick={() => alert('Hello from MDX!')}>
  Click me! I'm a React component in MDX
</Button>

## Getting Started

To use MDX Hybrid in your Vite project:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { mdxHybrid } from '@mdx-hybrid/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    mdxHybrid() // That's it!
  ]
}
```

The plugin will automatically:
- Detect if you're using remark/rehype plugins
- Choose the fastest available engine
- Provide full MDX compatibility

## Live Editing
