# Features

MDX Hybrid provides a unique approach to MDX compilation by combining two powerful engines.

## ðŸš€ Dual Engine System

### Rust Engine
- **5-10x faster** compilation for standard MDX
- Minimal dependencies
- Perfect for production builds
- Native performance

### JavaScript Engine
- Full compatibility with `@mdx-js/mdx`
- Support for all remark and rehype plugins
- Familiar API and behavior
- Maximum flexibility

## ðŸŽ¯ Smart Engine Selection

The compiler automatically selects the best engine based on your configuration:

```javascript
// Uses Rust engine (fast!)
compile('# Hello World')

// Uses JS engine (plugin support)
compile('# Hello', {
  remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm]
})

// Force specific engine
compile('# Hello', {
  engine: 'rust' // or 'js'
})
```

## ðŸ”§ Framework Support

<Alert>

### Currently Supported:
- âœ… **Vite** - You're using it right now!
- âœ… **Node.js** - Direct API usage
- ðŸš§ **Astro** - Coming soon
- ðŸš§ **Next.js** - Planned
- ðŸš§ **Webpack** - Planned

## ðŸ“¦ Drop-in Replacement

MDX Hybrid is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `@mdx-js/mdx`:

```diff
- import { compile } from '@mdx-js/mdx'
+ import { compile } from '@mdx-hybrid/core'
```

All your existing MDX files will continue to work exactly as before, just faster!
