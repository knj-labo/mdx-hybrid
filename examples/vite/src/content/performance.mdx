# Performance

MDX Hybrid delivers significant performance improvements for MDX compilation.

## Benchmark Results

Based on real-world testing, here's how the engines compare:

| File Size | Lines | JS Engine | Rust Engine | **Speedup** |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Small     | 10    | 5ms       | 1ms         | **5Ã—**      |
| Medium    | 100   | 25ms      | 4ms         | **6.25Ã—**   |
| Large     | 1000  | 150ms     | 20ms        | **7.5Ã—**    |

<Alert type="success">
  The Rust engine provides up to <strong>10Ã— faster</strong> compilation for large MDX files!

## When Each Engine is Used

### Rust Engine (Fast Path) 
Used when:
- No remark/rehype plugins are configured
- Standard MDX syntax is used
- Performance is critical

### JS Engine (Compatibility Path)
Used when:
- Custom remark/rehype plugins are needed
- Complex MDX transformations are required
- Maximum compatibility is needed

## Real-World Impact

In a typical documentation site with 100+ MDX pages:

- **Development**: ~80% faster hot reload
- **Production Build**: ~5Ã— faster builds
- **CI/CD**: Significantly reduced build times

## Memory Usage

The Rust engine also uses less memory:

```javascript
// Memory usage comparison
const jsEngine = "~150MB for large projects"
const rustEngine = "~30MB for large projects"
const improvement = "80% less memory usage! ðŸŽ‰"
```

## Try It Yourself

Check out the Node.js example to run performance benchmarks on your own MDX files:

```bash
cd examples/node
pnpm compile:benchmark
```
