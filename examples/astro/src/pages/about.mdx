# About MDX Hybrid

MDX Hybrid is a revolutionary approach to MDX compilation that combines the best of both worlds:

- **Rust Engine**: Blazing-fast compilation for standard MDX files
- **JavaScript Engine**: Full compatibility with the MDX ecosystem

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[MDX File] --> B{Has Plugins?}
    B -->|Yes| C[JS Engine]
    B -->|No| D{Rust Available?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Rust Engine]
    D -->|No| C
    C --> F[Compiled Output]
    E --> F
```

## Benefits

### For Development
- âš¡ Faster hot reloading
- ðŸ”§ Full plugin support when needed
- ðŸŽ¯ Zero configuration required

### For Production
- ðŸš€ 5-10x faster builds
- ðŸ“¦ Smaller memory footprint
- âœ… Same output quality

## Technical Details

The Rust engine is built with:
- `mdxjs-rs`: Rust implementation of MDX
- `napi-rs`: Node.js bindings
- Pre-built binaries for all major platforms

The JavaScript engine wraps:
- `@mdx-js/mdx`: The official MDX compiler
- Full remark/rehype ecosystem support
